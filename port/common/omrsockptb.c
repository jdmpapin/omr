 *
 * Per thread buffers (PTB) are used to store information that is not shareable among the threads.
 * For example when an OS system call fails the error code associated with that error is
 * relevant to the thread that called the OS function; it has no meaning to any other thread.
 *
 * This file contains the functions supported by the port library for creating, accessing and
 * destroying per thread buffers. @see omrsock.h for details on the per thread buffer structure.
