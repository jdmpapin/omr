/**
 * A utility class that prevents its subtypes from implicitly defining a
 * default copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
 *
 * To prevent a type from being copied, simply make it inherit from
 * TR::Uncopyable. Private inheritance is recommended because the subtyping
 * relationship is irrelevant to consumers of the subtype. Example:
 *
 * \code
 * class Foo : private TR::Uncopyable { ... };
 * ...
 * Foo x(otherFoo); // compile error
 * existingFoo = otherFoo; // compile error
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that such inheritance does not prevent subtypes from defining their own
 * copy constructors or copy assignment operators explicitly, though to do so
 * would be confusing.
